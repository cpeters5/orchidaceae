                            We use a component of your browser called cookie to recognize your computer. Cookies are small data files
                            that are saved on your hard drive when you visit websites. These files make browsing the sites easier.

                            We do not and cannot use cookies to retrieve your personal information from your computer.
                            The information collected is instead used for statistical purposes, among others to compute the number of

                            If you configure your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, a prompt will pop-up each time a site

                            OrchidRoots uses software to monitor traffic to the website in order to detect unauthorized attempts to
                            download or change information, or to otherwise damage the site. This software receives and records the IP address
                            of the computer used by the person visiting our website, the date and time of the visit and the pages viewed.
                            However, we do not attempt to make the connection between these addresses and the identities of the individuals
                            who visit our site, unless an intrusion or disruption attempt is detected.  In which case, intruding IP addresses
                            will be blocked from entering our website.
